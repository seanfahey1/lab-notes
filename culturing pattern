culturing pattern:
enrichment1 -> enrichment2 -> [RC1, RC2, RC3, ...] -> sometimes [RC1, RC2, RC3, ...]

enrichments are community of bacteria
RC are specific bacteria strains




FRAP - fragment recruitment (Ana Cobian)
	Greg knows where to get this program

	Gives you a map of reads from metagenome
	Recruits reads to a reference and shows where they align

	RUN THIS on the reads. We want to see if the reads from different contigs overlap with eachother. If they do, and if they blast to a phage, then we know that phage stays present through each enrichment/RC.



reason for k-mer stuff:
	see how many enrichments are actually needed to get out phages. Also if we're loosing anything by not choosing the right RC bacteria.
