01-26-2023	Running CD-Hit on IBD WGA fasta files for Anca.

** NOTE: If running big files, don't forget to increase sytem resources for docker.


Running CD-Hit on each file indicidually, then combining each file in each dataset into one master file and running CD-Hit on that.

2 datasets:
	WGA 9-18
	WGA 27-31

This is the process for WGA 9-18 dataset. Repeated same process for WGA 27-31.

0)	merged files with cat into "WGA9-18_combined.fasta"
		touch WGA9-18_combined.fasta
		cat WGA9... >> WGA9-18_combined.fasta
		repeat for each file

*)	using docker based cd-hit
	to build:
		docker build --tag cd-hit https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weizhongli/cdhit/master/Docker/Dockerfile

	to run with local dir mounted as volume:
		docker run -it --name cd-hit -v $(pwd):/opt cd-hit

1) cd-hit command:
		cd-hit \
		-i WGA10patricassembled_contigs.fasta \
		-o WGA10patricassembled_contigs_output.fasta \
		-c 0.9 \
		-n 5

	ran for each file in the directory

	scripted it out for the second dataset to save some time:

		rm WGA27-31_combined.fasta
		touch WGA27-31_combined.fasta

		for f in *contigs.fasta
		do
			echo $f
			cat $f >> WGA27-31_combined.fasta
			y=${f%.*}

			cd-hit -i $f -o $y"_output.fasta" -c 0.9 -n 5
		done

2) ran the cd-hit command for the merged file as well

3) re did everything at -c 0.7 as well (per anca email that came later)
	moved the 0.9 results to a separate 0.9 folder


	file structure (tree) for WGA27-31 example:
		.
		|-- WGA27-31_combined.fasta
		|-- WGA27_19029E2inRC119_assembly_contigs.fasta
		|-- ...
		|-- threshold_70pct
		|   |-- WGA27-31_combined_output.fasta
		|   |-- WGA27-31_combined_output.fasta.clstr
		|   |-- WGA27_19029E2inRC119_assembly_contigs_output.fasta
		|   |-- ...
		`-- threshold_90pct
		    |-- WGA27-31_combined_output.fasta
		    |-- WGA27-31_combined_output.fasta.clstr
		    |-- WGA27_19029E2inRC119_assembly_contigs_output.fasta
		    |-- ...


*)	Re-did all work with -d 0 flag for CD-Hit. Apparently the output description in the clstr file is truncated by default.
	command to automate:

for f in *contigs.fasta
do
	echo $f
	y=${f%.*}

	cd-hit \
	-i $f \
	-o $y"_output.fasta" \
	-c 0.7 \
	-n 5 \
	-d 0 
done
cd-hit \
-i WGA9-18_combined.fasta \
-o WGA9-18_combined_output.fasta \
-c 0.7 \
-n 5 \
-d 0 
mv *output* threshold_70pct

New method. Take .fasta outputs from cd-hit dereplications and merge each path. Then derep the path as a whole. This way we should see fewer contigs from the same WGA per cluster, and if we see multiple we know they aren't highly similar/overlapped.

Then re-do this for a combination of all WGAs (not specific paths)

code to do this:
for f in path*derep.fasta; 
do 
	y=${f%.*}"_output.fasta"
	cd-hit -i $f -o $y -c 0.7 -n 5
done

then for the combined file:
cd-hit -i ALL_WGA_after_wga_derep.fasta -o ALL_WGA_after_wga_derep_output.fasta -c 0.7 -n 5

** path#_after_wga_derep.fasta is the combined output.fasta files from the first run for each WGA from that path.

******---- I did something wrong for the ALL file. Somehow I grabed a file that was already dereplicated. Need to merge all WGA_outputs into a single file and redo this one.
	Repeated but same result. I'm rerunning it for the 90% thresh to see if anything is different for that group.
