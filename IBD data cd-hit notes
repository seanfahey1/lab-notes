01-26-2023	Running CD-Hit on IBD WGA fasta files for Anca.
Running CD-Hit on each file indicidually, then combining each file in each dataset into one master file and running CD-Hit on that.

2 datasets:
	WGA 9-18
	WGA 27-31

This is the process for WGA 9-18 dataset. Repeated same process for WGA 27-31.

0)	merged files with cat into "WGA9-18_combined.fasta"
		touch WGA9-18_combined.fasta
		cat WGA9... >> WGA9-18_combined.fasta
		repeat for each file

*)	using docker based cd-hit
	to build:
		docker build --tag cd-hit https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weizhongli/cdhit/master/Docker/Dockerfile

	to run with local dir mounted as volume:
		docker run -it --name cd-hit -v $(pwd):/home cd-hit

1) cd-hit command:
	cd-hit -i WGA10patricassembled_contigs.fasta -o WGA10patricassembled_contigs_output.fasta -c 0.9 -n 5
	ran for each file in the directory
