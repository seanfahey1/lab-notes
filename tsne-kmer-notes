culturing pattern:
enrichment1 -> enrichment2 -> [RC1, RC2, RC3, ...] -> sometimes [RC1, RC2, RC3, ...]

enrichments are community of bacteria
RC are specific bacteria strains


reason for k-mer stuff:
	see how many enrichments are actually needed to get out phages. Also if we're loosing anything by not choosing the right RC bacteria.



to-do:
- start with kmer size of 4 (256 possible nucleotide 4mers)
- get all kmers for each sequence. Calculate relative frequency for each contig/read.

- do this for contigs, then do this for read files.

- frap (ana cobian) can help with this, but Greg says that the plots don't work anymore 
(or only worked on ana's system?)
